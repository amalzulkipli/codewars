## About Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a coding practice platform where developers can improve their skills by solving coding challenges called "kata". Each kata has a difficulty level (kyu), with 8 kyu being beginner-friendly and 1 kyu being extremely challenging.

## Language Folders

Each language folder contains:
- Solutions organized by difficulty level or problem type
- Clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Comments explaining complex algorithms where necessary

## Progress Tracking

This repository serves as my personal journey through Codewars challenges. Feel free to browse the solutions, but I encourage you to attempt the problems yourself first!

## Getting Started

1. Visit [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) to create an account
2. Start with 8 kyu problems to build fundamentals
3. Work your way up to more challenging kata
4. Practice consistently to improve your problem-solving skills

## Contributing

This is a personal practice repository, but if you spot any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue!
