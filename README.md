# My Codewars Kata Solutions

This repo is just a dump of my Codewars kata answers. I solve problems in Python and JavaScript, and I add new files whenever I finish a kata I like or want to keep for reference.

## Folder Structure

- `Python/` â€” Python solutions
- `JavaScript/` â€” JavaScript solutions


Each file is named after the kata. No extra folders, no difficulty sorting.

## Why?

I use this repo to keep track of my progress and revisit old problems. If you find something useful, cool. If not, that's fine too. LOL

## Note

These are my own solutions. I don't guarantee they're the best or most optimal, but they work for me. Feel free to look around.
